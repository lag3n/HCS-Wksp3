# Intro to React and React Hooks âœ¨

In this introductory React workshop, you will extend your frontend development knowledge beyond basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. React is one of the most popular and widely used frontend libraries and can be used to scale and elevate web applications. We will cover React fundamentals and set you up with everything you need to know to start your first React project. 

For this workshop, we'll be building a fun little **restaurant app**!

In order to compile the React app, in your local repository run **npi i** and **npi start** after which your app will render!
